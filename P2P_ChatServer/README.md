Running the chat server:

1. Download folder Client_One and Client_Two
2. Run Client_One's BASH script 'buildClient.sh'
- This builds the docker client and also deletes Docker files that have the names used in the BASH scripts.
3. Run Client_Two's BASH script 'buildClient.sh' in a separate terminal
4. Chat between clients!

NOTE: Each time you run a bash script, you must have the Dockerfile inside each folder in order to properly build the containers.
